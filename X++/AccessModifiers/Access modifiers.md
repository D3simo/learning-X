# Access modifiers

Public: Default behaviour for classess and methods. A public class can be inherited and class methods can be overridden in subclasses and called outside the class.
Protected: Only methods can be protected. A protected method can be overridden in subclasses, but can only be used inside the class hierarchy.
Private: Both classes and methods can be set as private. However this will only affects methods. A private method can only be used within the current class.
