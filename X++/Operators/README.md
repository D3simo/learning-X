# Relational operators

    like : Returns true if expression1 is like expression2
    
    ! : Not

    != : Inequality operator (not equal to)

    && : Logiccal AND

    || : Logical OR

    < : Less than

    <= : Less than or equal

## Ternary operator

In this example : Return value based on condition

```X++
class test1
{
    public static void main(Args _args) 
    {
        int i;
        i = (4000 > 4) ? 1: 5;
        info(int2str(i));
    }
}
```
